# Windsurf Rule Prompt: Portfolio Website Development with React, Tailwind, and ShadCN

## 🎯 Goal
Develop a responsive and modern portfolio website for a front-end developer using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ShadCN UI** components. The design should be clean, accessible, and optimized for performance and mobile responsiveness.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** (latest version)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **ShadCN UI** (prebuilt accessible UI components)
- **Vite** or **Next.js** for fast development (optional)
- **TypeScript** (if needed)

## 🧠 Context
The portfolio should feature:
- A landing page with hero section
- About section with image and text
- Projects or work showcase grid
- Skills/Tech stack section
- Contact form or contact info
- Light/dark theme toggle using ShadCN’s theming system

## 📏 Rules
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
- Layout should be mobile-first and responsive across devices
- Use Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS unless necessary
- Prefer ShadCN components for buttons, cards, modals, forms, etc.
- Optimize images using modern formats (e.g., WebP)
- Use Tailwind `@apply` for reusable styles where appropriate

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Pages render correctly across modern browsers
- All ShadCN components are thematically consistent
- Navigation is intuitive and responsive
- Lighthouse score >90 on mobile and desktop
- Codebase is clean, modular, and reusable

## 🧪 Bonus (Optional)
- Add framer-motion animations for transitions
- Deploy on Vercel or Netlify with custom domain
- Add unit/component tests using Vitest or React Testing Library
